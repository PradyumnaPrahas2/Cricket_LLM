Brown had advanced well down the pitch, shortening the distance he would have to run to reach the other end, and was outside his safe ground as Mankad came up to deliver the ball.  Instead of bowling it, he threw it at the stumps where he was, appealed for a run out, and was awarded the decision.  This has happened a handful of times in international competition since then, however the Laws were changed in 2000 and now the 'Mankad is not a valid form of dismissal.",

There is no Hebrew word \"Jaffa\" as such, \"ya-fo\", the adjacent city to Tel Aviv, called \"Jaffa\" in English and the most common citing of it which you are probabaly already aware of is with relation to the exported oranges (\"Jaffa oranges\").

Nelson's name somehow got included in the mix by accident. An exhaustive survey by \"The Cricketer\" magazine in the 1990s suggested that the number 111 was actually no more unlucky than any other number in cricket (apart from 0 - the most common score that a batsman gets dismissed for by far), so here is one cricketing superstition which has an extremely confusing explanation, based on very little factual evidence whatsoever.",

Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser pronounced it, \"contrary to the traditions of the game\".  Bruce Edgar was at the non striker's end on 100 not out when the infamous ball was bowled.His is probably the most underrated and under discussed century in cricketing history.\r\nUnderarm bowling is now outlawed by the International Cricket Council as \"not within the spirit of the game\".",

This was an unlikely event given that the delivery was to be bowled to New Zealand's number ten batsman. Australia's captain Greg Chappell ordered the bowler, who just happened to be his younger brother Trevor, to bowl the final delivery. He asked that it be underarm along the ground. This ensured that a six was not scored and the New Zealand batsmen walked off the field in disgust. Who was the batsman who faced the controversial delivery?",

The next morning he appeared at the crease wielding an aluminium bat. The English players declared the bat was damaging the ball and Lillee was asked to change it.He refused and the game was stalled. Finally, Australian captain Greg Chappell made an appearance on the field to intervene. Lillee hurled his bat away in disgust, took up the willow version again and the game resumed.In the Perth match of 1981/82 test series against Pakistan, Lillee appeared to deliberately hinder Javed Miandad as he was completing a run. Miandad pushed Lillee out of his way in an effort to complete the single. Lillee immediately turned and kicked Miandad in the back of the leg with his left foot.At this point umpires intervened to separate the two volatile players.  Lillee did actually back Australia to lose in the Headingly test of 1981 (Australia lost) and more controversy swirled around the famous bowler.",

The Sri Lankans appealed confidently but umpire Rudi Koertzen gave Gilchrist \"not out\". Gilchrist, who later admitted he knew full well he was out, simply turned and walked back to the pavilion.His action became the focus of much heated discussion. Rather than be praised for his gutsy sportsmanship, he was ridiculed and criticised by players, sportswriters and commentators.Despite the incidents that have been recorded in this quiz, cricket has managed to retain the reputation of a fair game with fair play.

It's important to note the phrase \"from the bat\", as it's possible for a bowler to bowl a maiden over whilst the team concedes certain types of extras - leg byes and byes generally. This is still known as a maiden over, despite the fact that the team have conceded runs.The history of the term \"Maiden\" over is interesting. It would appear that the term first started as a cricketing term, before becoming more widely used as an expression meaning \"to sweep a young lady off her feet\" - certainly, there are no records of the latter use of the term pre-dating any cricketing references to the term. How it became a cricketing term is, I suspect, down to a pretty prosaic explanation - a lot more prosaic than the slightly \"Romantic\" ideal of charming a young lady to distraction!",

But for a period of about 30-45 minutes it looked like he would take the game away from Australia.He first got the dangerous David Warner out and then Michael Clarke with a clever bouncer. This brought all-rounder Shane Watson on to the pitch. He was welcomed by a fast bouncer by Riaz warning him of what was coming in the next few overs. What followed was total domination of the batsman by the bowler. Every ball that followed was fast and shoulder level or above with occassional full pitched deliveries. Watson was jumping around fending balls away, bending to save his head, hooking balls he normally wouldn't have. He was in a total mess. And Riaz sensing this started provoking Watson after every ball to make him lose his concentration.All this resulted in Watson hooking a fast bouncer directly to the fielder at fine-leg only for it to be dropped by Rahat Ali. A great spell of fast bowling rendered useless by that dropped catch. Australia were then at 79 for 3 and that wicket would have made the game tight and who knows what might have happened. But as the history books will say, Australia won that match and eventually the tournament. What they won't say is the story of a fast bowler bowling his hearts out only to be denied by fate.",

The boundary lines no longer matter as balls are smashed out of the grounds for massive sixes. Fielding placements are immaterial as batsmen tend to find the gaps in more innovative ways. All in all, the level of batting has certainly increased by a few rungs.The year 2010 was a landmark year when Sachin Tendulkar scored the first ever double century in ODIs. Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma followed soon with 200s. Then came Rohit Sharma's mammoth 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014. All these were scored in batting-friendly conditions in India.The ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 saw mammoth scores by teams with 400 being breached multiple times. But two individual batting performances that stood out were the double centuries by Chris Gayle (215 against Zimbabwe in Canberra) and Martin Guptill (237 not out against West Indies in Wellington). Both theses were phenomenal exhibitions of powerful batting. These innings along with many other quickfire knocks by other players highlight the path which the game of cricket is likely to follow with mammoth totals being  scored and chased thanks to power hitters and classical batsmen alike scoring at a faster rate.",

As it occurs late in the delivery it makes it difficult for the batsman to judge the changes whilst the ball is in the air.\r A simplistic explanation (taken from Wikipedia) of what occurs is taken from the former England bowling coach Troy Cooley:\r \"Reverse swing is all to do with the deterioration of the ball and the seam position in flight. As the ball becomes rougher, it will take on a different characteristic as it deteriorates. So if you present the ball as an out-swinger, the ball has deteriorated so much on the rough side that it takes on the characteristics of the shiny side. Which means a natural out-swinger will become an in-swinger and conversely, an in-swinger into an out-swinger.\"",

Achong was a left arm spinner, and he bowled a ball out of the back of his hand which turned in the opposite way to which the batsmen expected it to spin. Robbins was stumped out by the West Indian keeper, and stormed back to the dressing room - his first words when he got there were \"Would you believe it? Bowled out by a b****y Chinaman!\" - and the expression stuck in cricketing folklore from that moment onwards! \r Another version says it was Patsy Hendren, and not Robbins, who made the utterance after being bowled by Achong on the latter's debut in Port-au-Spain on the 1929-1920 MCC tour of the West Indies, whilst another version attrbutes the comment to Maurice Leyland (who also played against Achong on various occasions). Achong is the common bond in all of these stories, so he's obviously at the root of this piece of cricket folklore somewhere!",

The whole assembly must be a standard 9 inches wide.\r Traditionally, the \"wicket\" was made from a \"wicket\" gate - and therefore could be any width. This obviously led to all sorts of shenanigans as sides attempted to gain an advantage by choosing wider or narrower \"wickets\". Eventually, people settled on two stumps, but again, there was no standard width - so again, there could be all sorts of problems arising from this. Once these were standardized at 5 inches width (with one bail sitting on top of the two stumps), batsmen soon found that they could guard their wickets either by putting their leg in front of them, or by choosing to have a very wide bat made for themselves.\r As a batsman myself, I think this was all very fair, of course! Eventually, in 1774, standard laws were drawn up for the game, which increased the number of stumps to three, with two bails across them. At the same time, the LBW (Leg Before Wicket) Law was bought in, to stop batsmen indiscriminately covering the wicket with their legs, and another Law was brought in limiting the width of the bat. These laws have stayed in placed fundamentally unchanged since that time, thus ensuring an equal contest between batsman and bowler.",

After retiring, he became a keen administrator, taking a leading role both in the establishing of the Laws of cricket, as well as being a key administrator with the MCC, the sport's ruling body at the time.\r In 1890, he was appointed as the Governor of Bombay. By all accounts, he didn't do a great job of the political side of the role - but he did a huge amount to support cricket in . This included helping to establish clubs and regular competition by diverting funds and land in the right (cricketing!) direction.  However, the main criticisms of his tenure was that he spent too much time supporting cricket in  to the detriment of the substantive tasks of his role there.",

With American interest in cricket on the rise at both the professional and college level, the continued expansion of this sport can be expected to accelerate as was the case with football (soccer) in the late 20th century.

Traditionally, bowlers had aimed to hit the wickets, but in bodyline they bowled directly at the batsmen, hitting many of them.It was a brutal form of cricket, but while it worked against lesser batsmen, it was quickly mastered by Bradman.",

He was an intimidating swing bowler, a fearless batsman and an effective slip fielder.  In 102 test matches for England he scored 5200 runs, garnered 383 wickets and took 120 catches with fourteen centuries and a top score of 208.  He was also the first player to both score a century and take ten wickets in a test match. His performance with both bat and ball in the 1981 Ashes led to the series being dubbed \"Botham's Ashes\". \r Botham was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1978 and he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in August 2009.

Nicknamed the \"Haryana Hurricane\", he led India to its first ever World Cup victory in 1983 and is credited for changing how the one day game was perceived in India. A swashbuckling batsman, his innings of 175 not out against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup when India were reeling at 17/5 has been described as \"one of the most significant centuries ever in the one day game\".  As a bowler, his strength lay in his ability to move the ball rather than sheer pace.  This movement was particularly effective against tail-enders. \r His statistics speak for themselves. He was a mere 21 years of age when he achieved the test double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets.  With 434 test wickets and 5248 runs, he is one of a handful of players who have scored over 5000 runs and taken more than 400 wickets in test matches. Add to this 3748 runs and 253 wickets in one day internationals and it is no wonder that he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in March 2010.",

This places him amongst the elite and, to boot, he was also a gifted fieldsman at cover point.\r The choice for the second opener, literally, fell to a toss of the coin. It was difficult to separate between Alastair Cook and Leonard Hutton. By the time that he'd retired, Cook had amassed more Test runs than any other Englishman. A composed and patient batsman he would definitely have been a worthy opener in this line-up. Len Hutton revealed his greatness very early. He compiled a century in his second Test match and then, in his sixth Test, scored 364 which became the highest individual Test score until it was overtaken in 1958. Like Hobbs, he retired from Test cricket with an average a shade under 57 and scored 6,971 runs over the course of 79 Tests. What is remarkable about Hutton is that he badly broke his arm during World War II. The damage was so severe that he was forced to re-adjust his technique and use a shorter handled bat upon his return to cricket.",

He doesn't make the final eleven but I have given him the task of being this team's manager. This decision is based purely upon the success he achieved as captain of the West Indies team during the 1960s and respect that he'd earned during that period. Worrell became the first \"permanent\" black captain of the West Indies cricket team. It should be noted that this elevation came at a time when a \"White Australia\" policy was still in existence that prevented coloured people immigrating to the land \"down under\", at a time when the Maori Affairs Amendment Act in New Zealand was still years away from being enacted, at a time when South Africa was still refusing to play Tests against the West Indies because of the coloured players in their line-up and, at a time that Enoch Powell still hadn't delivered his racist \"Rivers of Blood\" speech. Despite all this Worrell guided his team through the 1960 series against Australia with such aplomb that nearly one quarter of Australia's population lined the streets of Melbourne for a parade to honour them. All future contests since, between these two nations, have been contested for the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy.\r Of Everton Weekes, Richie Benaud once said, that when Weekes came out to bat he had but one intention - \"to hammer the bowlers\". One of the hardest hitters that the game has seen Weekes only ever hit one six out of the ground in his Test career because, he claimed, there was a danger of breaking too many windows. His stats will show two sixes but his recollection was that the second was the result of overthrows. In his 48 Test match career he accumulated in excess of 4,500 runs at the amazing average of 58.61. In that total were 15 Test hundreds, five of which came in successive innings against a powerful Australian bowling attack. Remarkably, he was dismissed for 90 attempting the sixth.\r Clyde Walcott (although he was never knighted) is the gloveman for this line-up. Clyde was a wicketkeeper/batsman during his first 15 Tests for his country. In this role he had a Test batting average slightly over 40, which is an indication that he could have, potentially, been ranked amongst the greatest here. However, once he relinquished the gloves and played purely as a specialist batsman, his average rose to a whopping 64. His combination of power and grace once led to respected cricket writer, David Firth, describing his batting as \"an unforgettable mix of silk and gently rolling thunder\".",

Roberts was the first in an assembly line of great fast bowlers that evolved from the Caribbean Islands during the 1970s and 1980s. He loved the efficacy of the short pitched delivery and, while it was, at times, designed to hit the batsman, it wasn't to injure but to hasten their road to the surrender of their wicket.\r Whilst Roberts was blessed with raw speed it was his plotting mind that remained his secret weapon on the field. Michael Holding, one of his bowling partners, attested to the fact that Roberts was the master of working out the demise of a batsman and that he (himself) learned so much of his own craft from Roberts' advice. In his armoury Roberts had, what could be defined as, a \"lesser\" bouncer, which lulled batsmen into a false sense of security. Peter Toohey was one of those who, during the Australian tour of the West Indies in the 1977/78 season took advantage of one of these \"lesser\" bouncers and pulled it to the boundary for four. In his next over Roberts let fly a similar delivery, only yards quicker. Before Toohey realised what was happening he was struck between his forehead and the bridge of his nose. Newspapers, the following morning, showed photographs of a prone Peter Toohey being cradled by Viv Richards as he made desperate gestures to the change-rooms for assistance.",

Gilchrist, who later admitted he knew full well he was out, simply turned and walked back to the pavilion.His action became the focus of much heated discussion. Rather than be praised for his gutsy sportsmanship, he was ridiculed and criticised by players, sportswriters and commentators.Despite the incidents that have been recorded in this quiz, cricket has managed to retain the reputation of a fair game with fair play.
